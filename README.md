# I am trying to build a self driving car

This readme will not only cover my project goals, what I achieve, and how I do it. I will also log the important sub-problems I solve along the way. 

# The Journey
## Outlook
In my journey, I hope to cover my more pragmatic challenges and realizations. At the end of the day, this project involves hardware, and so I hope to bring you through the engineering and design in addition to the machine learning. (I have never worked with embedded systems, so I will be learning along the way too!)
### Day 1
Today, I hit factory reset on my computer. I saw that the memory was 67% occupied before even executing any programs. This to me, has just caused tremendous slow downs in my computer. Thus, I faced challenges re-installing everything. Related to this project, this will be the first time I am using Neovim and C++ for any project. Setting up Neovim took time and installing packages was difficult too. 

One major problem I faced today was that I did not have an HDMI chord for my RasberryPi (Pi). Thus, I cannot plug it into my monitor. I came up with the solutuion of giving my Pi ethernet. I figured I could connect to my Pi through my local network. Making matters harder was that Pi runs on Ubuntu. Even though I run Ubuntu on my Windows computer through wsl, this causes issues, since I cannot connect to my Pi through the given GUI. This link, however, allows me to run Linux applications on my Windows computer: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps.
